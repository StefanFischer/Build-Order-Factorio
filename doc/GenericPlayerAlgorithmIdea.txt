Read the given challenge-json file containing the initial game state
and the goal.

Create a list of base items. These items are:
 - All items the player is able to produce for free (The player is 
   a factory (see factory.json). Every recipe that matches one of the
   player's "crafting-categories" and that does not require any "ingre-
   dients" can be produced for free)
 - All items that can be produced using factories that are available 
   when starting the challenge ("initial-factories"). (...if these items
   can be produced using "free" items (see above) )

 - Create a tree structure using the goal item as the root node. (If 
   there are multiple goal items create multiple trees...)
 - Add a child node for every requirement that is necessary to reach 
   this (root) node. (e.g. one each for all necessary items, one for 
   the factory, one each for all necessary technologies, one for 
   the recipe).
 - For each of these child nodes, add all requirements they need in 
   order to be completeable.
 - Repeat the previous step until all leaf nodes are either base items
   or "initial-factories"

Then, iterate through the tree bottom-up to create a sequence of events
to reach the root node (aka the "goal-item"):
 - Produce all items, build all factories, research all technologies, 
   unlock all recipies specified in the lowest layer of the tree only, by
   raising the according events at the respective time.
 - After all of these are done, continue to the second layer (from the
   bottom) of the tree and produce everything specified there. Do this
   for each layer until you reach the root node.
 - As there is no time constraint / As we don't have to optimize the 
   build chain, all constructions can be done sequentially. (e.g. first
   raise event A, then, at a timestamp after A finished, raise event B, 
   although they could've been executed simultaneously)
